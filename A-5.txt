        1   Do you notice that each usage of local variable as an operand uses a
            suffix that can be tracked to it's assignment? Why do some variables
            have a suffix `(D)'?
            
        Answer1. Yes. The usage of local variable as an operand uses a suffix that can be tracked to its assignment. The siffix '(D)' is used for the variables if they are not assigned any value before usinf them in expressions. It indicates some error.

        2   Find the point in the CFG in  which the paths of the two assignments
            to variable `a'  and `b' merge. You will notice  that PHI statements
            have  been  introduced.  Can  you   guess  the  syntax  of  the  PHI
            statements?
            
       Answer2. The point in CFG in which the paths of the two assignments merge is bb4. Here PHI statements are used. Their syntax is -
       a_x1 = PHI<a_x2(D)(y),a_x3(c)>
Here x1 and x2 are any numbers used for arbitrary constants. '(D)' is not always present. It is present only if error is present. x3 is the temporary variable in which value of 'c' is stored. 'y' indicates that goto which controls program flow to this part. 

        3   Can you think of an example in which a PHI node merges more than two
            versions of a variable?

        Answer3. Here we can initialize a variable say 'a' two times in a single control flow i.e. 'a = 5' and 'a = 3' on next line. Here in this case the PHI node merges more than two versions of a variable.
