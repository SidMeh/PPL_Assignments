        1   Identify the basic blocks that correspond  to the while loop. How is
            the GIMPLE for a while loop different from simple if-else jumps?
            
        Answer1. The basic corresponding blocks to while loop are bb3 and bb4.
If we look to the gimple translation of while loop for this program, bb2 contains unconditional goto statement which transfers control to while loop condition and restricts iteration.

        2   Identify the  basic blocks  for the nested  for-loop. You  should be
            able  to identify  intializers, conditions  and increments  for each
            loop as  well as  the shared  inner body.  Is there  really anything
            special about a for-loop as compared to a while-loop?

        Answer2. Basic blocks for the nested loop:
        bb5 : Outer loop variable initialization.
        bb6 : Inner loop variable initialization.
        bb7 : Inner loop body and variable increment.
        bb8 : Inner loop condition checking.
        bb9 : Outer loop variable increment.
        bb10 : Outer loop condition checking.
