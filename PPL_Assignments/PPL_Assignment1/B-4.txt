        1   How many  times is the expression  (a + c) computed  in the original
            code (as seen in the SSA pass)? What about after the FRE pass?
            
        Answer1. The expression (a + c) is computed twice in the original code. In the FRE pass though the operands appear in different order, it is computed only once.

        2   Have  there been  any more  optimizations  after FRE?  How will  you
            check?
            
        Answer2. Yes. We can check if there have been further optimizations by checking B-4.c.*.optimized, which is the final file after the optimization. It appears that redundant assignments have been subsequently been eliminated.

        3   Why did  we have  to put a  "return b" in  this assignment?  What if
            "return b" is changed to "return 0"? Will it make any difference?
            
        Answer3. We have to put "return b" otherwise it would have been a dead code. Not returning b would result in elimination as dead code. It will definately make a difference.
