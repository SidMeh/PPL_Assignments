        1   In the file B-3.c, what values  can variable `a' take? Will the `if'
            condition [a  < 4] ever  be true?  Inspect the file  B-3.c.*.vrp1 to
            analyze the dump.
            
        Answer1. In the file B-3.c variable a will take values from 4 to 99 as thses values are within th scope of the loop. The 'if' condition [a<4] will never come true. The code taken in branch appears to have been eliminated.
